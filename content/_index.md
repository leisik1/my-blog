# Welcome to leisik's webpage!

Hi! My name is Daniel Kisiel and I am a young geek especially intrested in Infrastructure, Physics and Medical implementations of AI. Overall I love everything that involves numbers. This webpage is created mainly for me to push me to show others my projects and keep myself learning. Hope you will enjoy!
